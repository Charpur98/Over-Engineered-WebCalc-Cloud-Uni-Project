# Over-Engineered-WebCalc-Cloud-Uni-Project
    
This project was completed as part of a University Module to create a Web Calculator using a variety of cloud technologies.  
    
I used a number of different languages in this project, this includes, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, GoLang and Python.
    
I made use of Docker to create containers for each of the main operation functions for the calculator, the main functions are Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Square Root, Modulus and Power Of. 


As this project relies on cloud servers, the application will not work as it is now offline.
